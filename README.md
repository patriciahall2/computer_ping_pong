#### SYNOPSIS
Computer Ping Pong is a webpage designed to determine whether the number the user enters is divisible by 3, 5, or 15 by returning the result "ping" for numbers entered divisible by 3, "pong" for numbers divisible by 5, and "pingpong" for numbers divisible by 15. The number the user enters will
result in the display of each number counting up to the number chosen
and show which numbers in the sequence are "ping", "pong", or "pingpong" or divisible by 3,5,and 15 respectively. This game can help you refine and test your skills in division. Can you predict what the sequence will be?
